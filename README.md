# Dog Emotion Recognition

## Project Description:

**Dog Emotion Recognition** is a project that leverages deep learning techniques to classify the emotional states of dogs based on their images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model identifies four primary emotions: happiness, sadness, relaxation, and anger.

### Project Goals:

The goal of this project is to build an efficient image classification model capable of accurately identifying dog emotions with a high degree of precision. Such a model can help in the study of animal behavior, improve the way dogs are cared for, and understand their emotional states.

### Technologies & Tools:

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building, training, and evaluating the Convolutional Neural Network.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: For automatic image classification based on features.
- **Google Colab**: For computational resources and training the model in the cloud.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the training process and evaluation results.
- **EarlyStopping**: For optimizing the training process and preventing overfitting.

### Key Project Steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset consisted of images of dogs representing four key emotional states: happiness, sadness, relaxation, and anger.
   - The data was split into **training** and **validation** sets to allow the model to learn and validate its results.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with several convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers was built for image classification.
   - ReLU activation function was used for better performance, with a softmax layer at the output for multi-class classification.
   - EarlyStopping was employed to stop the training once the accuracy reached **95%**, preventing overfitting.

3. **Model Training**:
   - The model was trained on the training dataset for up to 10 epochs, but with EarlyStopping, training halted once 95% accuracy was achieved.
   - The Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function were used for multi-class classification.

4. **Results Visualization**:
   - After training, graphs showing the accuracy and loss over time were created for both the training and validation datasets, helping assess the model's performance.

### Results:

- The model achieved **95% accuracy** on the validation dataset after 8 epochs, demonstrating a strong capability in classifying dog emotions.
- Based on the training results, the model effectively learned to recognize emotional states in dogs based on visual features.

### Conclusion:

The **Dog Emotion Recognition** project showed that Convolutional Neural Networks can be highly effective in classifying animal emotions from images. The model achieved high accuracy in a short training period, highlighting the potential of these methods in studying animal emotions.

### Future Directions:

- Expanding the dataset to include more emotional states.
- Using the model to analyze the behavior of other animals.
- Integrating into real-world monitoring systems or pet care devices that can automatically analyze a dog's emotional state.
